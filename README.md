# Count Number Of Vehicles Exiting and Entering an Intersection

Hi,

In this repo, You will see how I counted different vehicles at two seperate locations

## Step 1: Install all requirements
`pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Step 2: Run the `python` file
`python traffic_count.py`



### Side Notes:
1. I want to add the functionality to save a json file that containes the final nunmber of vehicles counted for both ways.
2. I want to dockerize this file
